# Convert Webp to JPEG

Wanted to download images from the internet and got tilted when they came in WEBP format!!!

## How to use the program?
The program will detect any file that ends with ".webp" and convert it to a JPEG

Ideally, you would want to create a folder with your .webp images!!


### Can't import PIL/PILLOW???
``` 
 # Uninstall it by running this in command line
 pip uninstall Pillow

 # Now reinstall the program
 pip install Pillow
```
This resolved my "No module named PIL" error
